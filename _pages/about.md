I am a PhD student in the Goal-Oriented Long-Lived Systems (GOALS) group at the Oxford Robotics Institute.
I joined the group in 2023, being supervised by Nick Hawes and Bruno Lacerda.

My research covers multi-agent planning under uncertainty, covering topics like:
- Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
- Graph Neural Networks
- POMDP algorithms 

In 2023, I was awarded a prestigious scholarship from the John Monash Foundation, supporting outstanding Australians pursuing postgraduate studies overseas.

Before joining the ORI, I worked as a Rapid Prototyping Engineer at Myriota, developing algorithms for ultra low-energy direct-to-orbit satellite communications.
Prior to that, I earned a Bachelor of Engineering (Mechatronics) and a Bachelor of Maths and Computer Science from the University of Adelaide, graduating as Valedictorian.

I am part of the leadership team for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/robotics-inclusive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robotics Inclusive</a> - please get in contact if you'd like to be involved in making the robotics community accessible to all.
